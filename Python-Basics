#1.Python Program to Calculate the Average of Numbers in a Given List

arr = []
for i in range(0,n):

#2.Python Program to Exchange the Values of Two Numbers Without Using a Temporary Variable
#My way of doing it!
a = [1]
b = [6]
print("The value of a is: ")
print(a)
print("The value of b is: ")
print(b)
a[0] = 6
b[0] = 1
print("The value of a is: ")
print(a)
print("The value of b is: ")
print(b)

#optimum solution!
a = int(input("Enter the value of first variable: "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of second variable: "))
a = a + b
b = a - b
a = a - b
print("a is:",a, " b is:",b)
